## v1.2.1 — BW mode reps bug fix (2026-05-22)

**Tag:** `v1.2.1`

### What changed

**BW mode reps never counted as real sets.** In bodyweight mode, sets are created with `prefilled: true`. The normal flow clears `prefilled` inside `handleRepInput` → `if (isRealSet(set))` — but `isRealSet` requires `!prefilled`, making it a deadlock: prefilled can never clear itself. In non-BW mode `handleWeightInput` breaks the deadlock by clearing `prefilled` when weight is typed; BW mode has no weight typing (value is pre-populated). Fix: clear `prefilled` directly when `reps > 0`, before the `isRealSet` check. Also cleared `prefilled` in `handleBWInput` for the case where user touches the BW input first.

## v1.2.0 — P3 performance + minor quality (2026-05-21)

**Tag:** `v1.2.0`

### What changed

**P3#11 — `getLastSession` called once per render, not once per exercise card.** `renderExercises` now fetches `lastSession` once and passes it into `renderExerciseCard`. Added `computeProgressionFromSession(exName, lastSession)` to avoid the redundant call inside `computeProgression`. For a 6-exercise session this cuts `load()`+`JSON.parse()` from ~7 calls to 2.

**P3#12 — `computeProgression` uses last set's weight instead of first.** Changed `realSets[0].weight` to `realSets[realSets.length - 1].weight`. The final set is a better indicator of where to start next session (accounts for warmup progressions like 175→180→185 lb).

**P3#13 — Removed dead `calYear !== undefined` / `calMonth !== undefined` guards.** `init()` always sets both before any render call, so these checks never evaluated the fallback branch.

## v1.1.0 — P2 dead code + latent bugs (2026-05-21)

**Tag:** `v1.1.0`

### What changed

**P2#6 — Removed `_origSaveDurModal` dead code.** The `const _origSaveDurModal = ...` line always captured `null` (defined before `saveDurModal`) and was never read.

**P2#7 — Removed swipe-to-delete dead code.** `swipeStart`, `swipeMove`, `swipeEnd`, `swipeStartX`, and `.set-row.swiped` CSS were never attached to any element. CLAUDE.md documents no swipe-to-delete.

**P2#8 — Removed orphaned `.is-pr` class emission.** The CSS rule `.ft-metric-val.is-pr` was removed in a prior session (all values are cyan); the class was still being added to the DOM. Also removed the `isPR` IIFE that computed it.

**P2#9 — Fixed `getFitnessBest`, `ftTrendIcon`, and `prCount` BSS comparison.** All three were comparing BSS `{weight, reps}` by `.reps` only — 20 reps at 25 lb incorrectly beat 18 reps at 50 lb. Added `bssScore(v) = v.weight * 1000 + v.reps` composite. Weight takes precedence; reps break ties.

**P2#10 — Explicit `Number()` coercion in `isRealSet`.** Changed `s.reps > 0` to `Number(s.reps) > 0` to make the string-to-number coercion explicit and safe.

## v1.0.0 — Fitness sync + 5-bug fix (2026-05-21)

**Tag:** `v1.0.0`  
**Commit:** see tag

### What's in this release

**Features complete as of this save point:**

- Full workout tracker — Push / Pull / Legs / Cardio / Rest / 8-day rotation
- Calendar screen (month + week strip views) with type-colored tiles, set counts, duration, progress bars
- Workout screen — exercise cards, set rows (weight/reps/effort/adjustment/notes), apnea block (6 rounds, per-day-type targets), Mark Complete validation
- Timer panel — stopwatch + countdown tabs; preset buttons (hold-to-delete); pip overlays for both timers when panel is closed
- Fitness test screen — 10 built-in fields (including compound BSS and walking-apnea-with-steps), dynamic field config (add/remove/reorder), prev/best display, tooltips, notes per field, duration tracking, auto-save on input, history with PR badges, delete records
- Supabase sync — last-write-wins per session; plan record (`david_plan`); meta record (`david_meta`) for fitness_records, injured_days, fitness_test_days
- Header — Spearo + hogfish SVG, dumbbell icon (fitness), cloud icon (sync), circular-arrow (reload), warmup ⓘ, timer ⏱
- iOS standalone PWA — `hardReload()` uses `location.reload(true)`

**Bugs fixed in this release (from review):**

1. Fitness records, injured days, and fitness-test days were never synced to Supabase — now stored in `david_meta` record
2. `prevNote` placeholder dropped after pill tap (`refreshSetRow`) or set delete — fixed via `getPrevNotesForExercise()` helper
3. `getCurrentWeekNumber()` hardcoded to 5 — now returns max week number from loaded plan
4. Tapping a past fitness-test calendar tile reset the form date to today — `showFitness(iso)` now accepts optional date
5. Custom fitness field labels showed blank in history — now resolved via `cfgLabelMap` from live config

## How to create a new save point

After a significant change is working and tested, run:

```bash
# 1. Stage and commit
git add index.html RELEASES.md
git commit -m "vX.Y.Z — <short description>"

# 2. Tag it
git tag vX.Y.Z

# 3. Push commit + tag to GitHub
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z
```

Then add an entry to this file above (newest at top).

## Revert instructions

```bash
# See what changed between two releases
git diff v1.0.0 v1.1.0 -- index.html

# Revert index.html to a specific release (leaves RELEASES.md untouched)
git checkout v1.0.0 -- index.html

# After reverting, push the rollback as a new commit
git add index.html
git commit -m "revert: roll back to v1.0.0"
git push origin main
```
